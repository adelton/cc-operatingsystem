<chapter title="Purpose" id="purpose">
This Configuration Annex to the Protection Profile (PP) for General Purpose
Operating Systems provides configuration requirements for operating systems.
This Annex is consistent with <cite linkend="CNSSI-1253"/>, which requires US National Security
Systems to adhere to certain configuration parameters. Accordingly, configuration
guidance produced according to the requirements of this Annex is suitable for
use in US National Security Systems.

<br/>
These configuration requirements serve the following audiences:

<audiencetable>
<audience>
  <audiencename>IT Product Vendors</audiencename>
  <audiencepurpose>Use these
  guidelines to structure the creation of product-specific configuration
  guidance produced as part of a Common Criteria evaluation.  The creation of
  administrative guidance is required by NIAP-approved Protection Profiles.
  The items specified in this document, as well as any best practices, should be
  provided as part of the administrative guidance.  For each configuration item,
  the guidance must include the steps necessary to configure the setting of the
  product.
</audiencepurpose>
</audience>

<audience>
  <audiencename>Test Labs</audiencename>
   <audiencepurpose>Use these guidelines to configure and test systems undergoing evaluation
  against a NIAP-approved Protection Profile.  Using this guidance during evaluation
  provides assurance that the guidance is correct and implementable.
  </audiencepurpose>
</audience>

<audience>
<audiencename>Network Owners and Assessors</audiencename>
<audiencepurpose>Use these guidelines to assess the configuration of operational
systems when product-specific guidance does not exist.

<section title="Relationship to NIST 800-53 Security Controls" id="relcontrols">
In order implement of NIST SP 800-53 security controls, each component of the
information system must possess the necessary security functionality and also be
properly configured to leverage that functionality.
<br/>
NIAP Protection Profiles express requirements
for security functionality for individual IT products within the overall
information system.  This includes management functions which indicate where an
enterprise or end user is expected to be able to operationally configure the
product.  However, the Protection Profile does not indicate specific values
for each configuration setting. This Annex specifies those specific
requirements for operational configuration of a product type.  It also provides
a mapping to each NIST control which the operational setting helps the overall
system implement.  This complements the control mapping provided with each
Protection Profile, which is focused on security functionality.  Together, these
documents support the creation of system security plans, as well as the Select,
Implement, Assess, and Monitor steps of the Risk Management Framework (RMF).

<chapter title="Configuration Requirements" id="configreqs">
The table below describes configuration
requirements for operating systems.
<br/>
Each configuration requirement is
associated with a security functionality requirement (SFR) from the associated
Protection Profile or Extended Package.  Each configuration requirement is also
associated with a NIST 800-53 security control.
